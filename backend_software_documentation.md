# MESSAGING APPLICATION FOR THE ARMED FORCES OF NIGERIA (AFNCOM)

This document outlines the design and key components of a secured messaging system specifically tailored for the Armed Forces of Nigeria. The app allows for efficient and secure communication among personnel, while ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

## OVERVIEW

The system is designed to facilitate secure messaging within the Armed Forces of Nigeria. It supports real-time communication while maintaining a robust backend infrastructure that ensures secure access and data protection. This mobile app enables military personnel to communicate effectively, fostering operational efficiency and coordination across different units.

## KEY FEATURES

1. **Messaging Capabilities:**
    - **Real-Time Messaging:** Personnel can send and receive messages instantly, enhancing communication.
    - **Group Messaging:** Administrative users can create groups for team communications, enabling focused discussions.
   
2. **Military-Grade Security:**
    - **OTP Authentication:** The system utilizes Twilio for one-time password (OTP) authentication, ensuring secure access for military personnel.
    - **JWT Tokens:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are employed for session management, providing secure and controlled access to the app.
    - **SHA256 Password Encryption:** User passwords are securely stored using SHA256 encryption, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
   
3. **Mobile Accessibility:** 
    - The app, developed using Flutter, is accessible via mobile devices, allowing personnel to communicate and manage messages from anywhere.

## WORKFLOW

### 1. User Authentication:
   - Military personnel enter their phone number and receive an OTP via SMS and e-mail.
   - After OTP verification, they gain access to the app using a secure JWT token.

### 2. Managing Military Units:
   - **Headquarters:** Military units are created and named to represent different divisions of the armed forces.
   - **Directorates:** Directorates can be created under each headquarters.
   - **Teams:** Teams are formed within directorates to facilitate communication among specialized units.

### 3. Messaging Data:
   - **Send Messages:** Users can send messages to individuals or groups, capturing the context and content of the communication.
   - **View Message History:** Users can access their messaging history, ensuring important communications are retained.

### 4. Security and Access Control:
   - Secure access is ensured through OTP authentication and JWT session management.
   - Sensitive data, such as passwords, is stored using SHA256 encryption, adhering to military-grade security standards.

## BENEFITS FOR THE ARMED FORCES OF NIGERIA

1. **Centralized Communication:** The app consolidates all messaging into one platform, allowing for streamlined communication among military personnel.
2. **High Security:** With the implementation of OTP, JWT, and encryption, the app ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
3. **Mobile-First Solution:** Given the distributed nature of military operations, the app allows officers and commanders to communicate and manage messages remotely from their mobile devices.
4. **Scalability:** The system is designed to accommodate the large-scale communication needs of the Nigerian military.

This app will significantly enhance the way the Armed Forces of Nigeria manage secure communications, providing a modern, efficient platform for handling the complexities of military messaging. By leveraging advanced security features, mobile accessibility, and scalability, the app ensures that military personnel can maintain effective communication while upholding the highest standards of data security.

## USER GUIDE

### Introduction

The Secured Messaging System allows military personnel to manage and organize communication under various headquarters, directorates, and teams. Military personnel can send messages, update contact details, and organize their associations with headquarters and directorates.

### Features Overview

1. **Messaging Capabilities:** Send and manage messages between personnel and staff members.
2. **Voice and Video Calls:** Facilitate real-time communication through secure voice and video calls, enhancing collaboration among military personnel.
3. **Media Sharing:** Enable the sending of various media types, including photos and PDFs, allowing for the efficient sharing of important documents and information.

## HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM

### Authentication:
Personnel register and create an account by providing necessary details (e.g., phone number, email).
Authentication is typically managed through secure protocols such as OAuth or JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring that only authorized users can access the messaging features.

### User Management:
The backend stores user profiles, including their unique identifiers, contact details, and status (online/offline).
User presence is monitored and updated in real-time to reflect whether users are available for communication.

### Message Handling:
When a personnel sends a message, it is transmitted to the backend server.
The server processes the message, determines the recipient, and stores the message in a database for retrieval.
Messages can be sent as text, images, videos, or documents (such as PDFs), and the backend handles different media types accordingly.

### Real-Time Communication:
WebSocket or similar protocols are often used to facilitate real-time communication. This allows messages to be pushed to recipients immediately without requiring them to refresh their application.
The server maintains a persistent connection with clients, enabling instant message delivery and notifications.

### Message Storage:
Sent messages are stored in a database, organized by conversation threads or chat groups. This allows users to access message history.
The database can be optimized for quick retrieval, ensuring users can load their chat histories seamlessly.

### Notification System:
The backend handles push notifications to alert users about new messages or activities within the app.
Notifications can be customized based on user preferences.

### Data Security:
The backend implements encryption protocols to ensure that messages are securely transmitted over the network.
Sensitive data, such as user credentials and messages, may be encrypted at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.

### Group Messaging:
The backend supports group messaging features by managing multiple participants within a directorate and its teams in a conversation. Messages sent to a group are stored and delivered to all members of the group.
The backend handles the management of group memberships and roles, ensuring that permissions are correctly enforced.

### Media Management:
For media files (photos, videos, documents), the backend typically stores them in a file storage service or cloud storage and maintains references in the database.
Users can upload and share media, which the backend processes and ensures that files are accessible to intended recipients.

### Admin Controls and Analytics:
The backend may include administrative controls for monitoring user activity, managing user accounts, and analyzing message traffic for performance improvements.
Analytics tools can be integrated to track usage patterns, engagement metrics, and system performance.

## DEVELOPER GUIDE
